# HOPIN

Hopin is an online venue platform where they accommodate customers who want to host online events. They have a virtual booth, virtual stage, virtual backstage, and virtual reception desk to name a few. Your goal in this project is to create a prototype of parts of the product.
You need to build a peer to peer live streaming application where
● One user act as the presenter, others act as participants
● Application is running in the browser.
● The presenter can share their screen, so other participants can view the screen seamlessly on the other side. ● There’s no requirement in tech stack, you can choose any language or platform you like.
● Host your app in a free Heroku instance.
● Host your code in GitHub or other public repository.
Send us both the live link and the repository link for us to check.
